# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a snapshot of key metrics for a school district. An array of metrics were anaylzed, like spending per student. This analysis was conducted at different levels of granularity, from the district level to the individual grades themselves. This analysis was ultimately altered by having to exclude a portion of the data due to possible academic fraud. This is addressed in the following sections.


## Results
The removal of the Thomas High School 9th grade Math & Reading scores altered the analysis in the following ways.

1. The District Summary's Average Math Score decreased by 0.1, % Passing Math dropped 0.2%, % Passing Reading dropped 0.3%, and the % Overall Passing dropped 0.1%. This is shown in the following images:

 3. These alterations did not knock them out of the #2 spot for performance. But it allow Griffin High school in 3rd to close the gap. 
 
 4. For Math & Reading by Grade, the Thomas 9th grade for both categories were given a 'nan' value. Also shown below:
 
 5. Scores by School Spending was not effected by the removal.
 
 6. Scores by School Size was also not effected by the removal.
 
 7. Scores by School Type was also not effected by the removal.

## Summary
In summary, the removal of the Thomas High School 9th grade Math & Reading scores effected some areas but not others. It changed the District's Summary averages slightly, as well as Thomas' own Average and % scores. It also allowed another school to get closer to unseating them from their #2 spot in the district. The last effect this change had was that it caused the analysis to take longer than it should have, thus delaying important information to the district board in making decisions regarding funding. 

This alteration shows that any academic dishonesty can have wide reaching effects that can damage not only the indiviual students future, but their school, and even their district as well.
